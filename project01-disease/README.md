### Project: Disease Model Simulation

Due: Wednesday, March 5th end-of-day

In this project, you will work in a team to build an application that simulates a disease/virus moving through a population. Each team has their own private repository that only team members can see. You will make use of the skills that you have been working on to develop code in this team environment.

Communication is key! Make sure you are all communicating with each other about which part you are working on. The sliders in the ControlPanel and the StatsPanel are pretty independent. However, a lot of the other enhancements are in Population.java and Person.java. You will interfere with each other if you do not coordinate your efforts.

Each of you should take on one of the following roles. I suggest that you choose one that matches your strengths.

- **Communications Manager**. This person is in charge of keeping everyone up-to-date on what is happening. This person might use social media or some message board to coordinate communication. They might coordinate a meeting or make everyone aware of a problem that needs attending to. 

- **Git Manager**. This person establishes the repo with the starter code. They make sure the .gitignore and collaborators.txt is correct. As well as ensure that no class files or docs are being pushed to the repo. They keep an eye on the branches, and try to help others with git and with merging.

- **Git Issues Manager**. This person works closely with the Team Coordinator. They are in charge of managing the issues on gitlab. They will keep a close eye on who is assigned to each issue and check that against who has active branches. They compare branch names to issues.

- **Team Coordinator**. This person helps each team member pick their next issue(s) to tackle. This person knows generally what everyone is working on to try to avoid merge conflicts. They check in regularly to see where the problems are and to coordinate effort among team members to address problems.

- **Code Manager**. This person keeps an eye on the main branch. The main branch should always be functional. This person should periodically run the main branch and make sure everything is looking and operating as expected.

### Getting Started

The Git Manager should create a repo. Please name the repo **username-repo-project01**. Clone the repo. Pull the github class repo and copy the code into the gitlab repo. Create a .gitignore. Push to gitlab.

Now everyone can clone the repo.

The Git Manager creates a collaborators.txt when they get a chance.

Communications: think about how you want to communicate.

Team Coordinator: review the issues with everyone and start to identify a place to start for each team member. Think about how the team will track who is working on which part. 

Git Issues Manager: decide how the team should manage the issues. Are you going to add them all to the repo or is each person going to add them as you go?

Code Manager: Think about how the team will conduct merges with the main branch. Discuss the process. Probably document that process.

> NOTE: You can use the readme.md at the top level of the repo as a way to track the team and communicate information. Or perhaps a google doc with each issue and its status would be helpful.


<hr>

The file issues.md lays out many, many enhancements for the application. For each issue, the branch name has been specified. Please use these branch names. As you take on an issue, please add it to gitlab and create the branch.

> NOTE: branch names are case sensitive. Keep everything lower case so you do not accidentally create 2 branches of the same name except with different capitalization.

Please use the gitlab "merge request" for merging branches with main. It is so much easier. And please be careful and thoughtful when merging. Everyone makes mistakes and this is a new developing skill for most of you. **So, don't rush when merging. Look at all the information on the screen and make sure it makes sense. If you are not sure, just ask a team member or Dr. Larson to watch as you complete it.** Most things are recoverable, but it is better to not have to do that. 

Keep in mind that your branch is YOUR branch. If you mess it up, you can start over. It only impacts others when it is merged with main. Many of the issues are quite small in nature. If you take on a more challenging issue, push often in case you have to revert back to a previous version.

**As a team, you do not have to resolve all the issues!** Each person earns points for completing a feature/issue. Each person can decide how many they want to complete for points. There should be 1 person per issue OR you can pair program and split the points.

**As a team, you decide on the order in which to complete the issues.** However, there should be s few sliders complete with the underlying functionality working. For example, the probability of transmission and then being able to see the virus transmit and move through the population.

As part of the project, each student will write their own report about their contributions to the project. They will also complete a google form to reflect on the contributions of their teammates.

In this report, you will provide answers to the following. Use complete sentences and make it clear which question you are answering.

- The role that you chose and some examples of what you did in that role.

- A reflection on how you were a good team player. How would you rate yourself as a team player? Was there a time that you helped someone debug or think through the logic? Did you help someone merge their code or fix something on their branch? 

- A couple of examples of how a team member helped you.

- The issues that you resolved.


**ASSESSMENT**

You will be assessed on both your technical and teamwork accomplishments. In general:

- 4 pts: How well you carried out the Role that you chose.

- 4 pts: Being a good team player (as evidenced by your self-reporting and the reporting by your team mates).

- 3 pts: Completing the report at the end of the project. Please submit via MOODLE (link in week of Mar 03)

- 2 pts: Consistent contribution to the project. This means that I can see regular commits to the project.

- 2 pts: Good git management. This means that you were consistent in using branches and naming them correctly. You were careful and thoughtful when performing merges into main. If you are feeling shaky about merging with main, put in the merge request and ask if someone on your team can help you complete it.

- 10 pts: +2 pts per resolved issue, meaning the code is merged into main and is functional. _The sliders are pretty easy to implement and once you have done 1 of them, the others will be even easier. For that reason, I will give 2 pts for the first slider, but only 1 pt for any subsequent slider (for that same person). Another person can complete their first slider for +2 pts._

Total of 25 points (weighted as 10% of your grade).
